## Description

Mask V12 EA is a high-frequency trading expert advisor developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to perform scalping strategies in the forex market. This expert advisor executes trades based on predefined input parameters, including lot size, stop loss, and take profit levels.

## How It Works

The Mask V12 EA operates within the MetaTrader platform using the MQL language. It includes necessary trading functions from the Trade library. The expert advisor follows a simple logic flow:

1. The OnInit() function is called during initialization and prints an initialization message.

2. The OnTick() function is executed on every tick. It first checks for any news events using the IsNewsEvent() function.

3. If a news event is detected, the PauseTrading() function is called, and trading is paused until the news event is over.

4. If no news event is detected, the expert advisor continues to execute its trading strategies. The specific strategies for high-frequency trading and scalping are not described in detail in the code but are implemented in this section.

5. The expert advisor then executes a trade using the OrderSend() function, based on the predefined input parameters.

6. After executing the trade, the expert advisor checks if the trade was successful by analyzing the ticket number returned by OrderSend().

7. Finally, the main() function calls the OnInit() and OnTick() functions to start the expert advisor.
